# File_Tree_Export
Scans Folder/Drive and creates a File Tree in a .html file with some features

Just place the script into the folder/drive you want to scan and run it.
It will create a .html in the same place and open it automatically.

ToDo: the search feature is not finished. If you open a folder, which the search feature found, you will only see contents that too match the search, which is often not the case.
